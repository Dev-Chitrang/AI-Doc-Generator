    Processes a project by scanning its codebase, generating docstrings for each file,
    and creating a README.md file.

    Args:
        directory (str): The path to the project directory to be processed.

    This function performs the following steps:
    1. Scans the project directory to identify all code files.
    2. For each code file, generates and inserts docstrings using the `docstring_generator`.
    3. Writes the updated code back to the respective files.
    4. Generates a README.md file summarizing the project using the `readme_generator`.

    It prints the progress and any errors encountered during the process.
